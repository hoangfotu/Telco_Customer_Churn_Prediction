# Telco_Customer_Churn_Prediction
Predict Telco Customer Churn using Decision Tree &amp; Random Forest Classifier

**OVERVIEW**

This project aims to descriptive analyse and predict the **Likeliness to Churn** of Customers in a fictional Telco Company, using machine learning techniques. Customers churn refers to the phenomenon where customers of a product or service stop using it over a given period of time. By accurately identifying potential churners, businesses can take proactive measures to retain them and mitigate revenue loss.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to train and deploy a churn prediction model. The model is built on historical user data and utilizes various features to make accurate predictions.

**FEATURES**

Data preprocessing: The project includes scripts and functions to preprocess raw user data, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation. Model training: The repository provides code to train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. Multiple algorithms and techniques can be experimented with to find the best-performing model. Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics and scripts to assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics measure the accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant statistics. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new customer data.
